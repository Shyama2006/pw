 <h1>ARMY</h1>

 <p>BTS ARMY
     A.R.M.Y (아미): BTS's official fanclub name, 
     also known as the BTS ARMY amongst western media. 
     "A.R.M.Y" stands for Adorable Representative M.C. for Youth. 
     ARMY also represents a military and because 방탄소년단 directly translates to 
     “Bulletproof Boy Scouts,” ARMY (military) and BTS (the armor) would always be together.</p>
